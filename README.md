# SimGHYP

The Generalized Hyperbolic Distribution is a very flexible density with
many usages in finance. Unfortunately, this flexibility comes with a
price: six parameters have to be estimated, which can make it hard to
distinguish the parameters impact.

This dashboard aims to make GHYP more intuitive and, hopefully, more
fun!
