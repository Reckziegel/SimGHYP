# SimGHYP

The Generalized Hyperbolic Distribution is a very flexible density with many usages in finance. Unfortunately, this flexibility comes with a price: five parameters have to be estimated, which can make it hard to distinguish between their marginal impact.

This dashboard aims to make GHYP more intuitive and, hopefully, more fun!
